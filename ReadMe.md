## BMI 883/884: Biomedical data science professional skills

This repository contains the source for the website for the course
[Biomedical data science professional
skills](https://kbroman.org/BMI883), a graduate course at
[UW-Madison](https://wisc.edu) that is part of the [Biomedical Data
Science PhD program](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/education/current-students/phd-bds/).

A variety of skills that are important for a successful research
career are often left to students to develop on their own.
This course aims to fill many of those gaps, including writing and
reviewing papers, securing research funds, giving talks, presenting
posters, making a personal website, job opportunities in universities
and industry, and teaching.

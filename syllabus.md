[University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu) <br/>
(2 credits)

**Course meetings**: Mon & Fri 10:00-10:50am, 5530 [Morgridge Hall](https://map.wisc.edu/s/l44vvws8)

**Office hours** by appointment

A variety of skills that are important for a successful research
career are often left to students to develop on their own. This course
attempts to fill many of those gaps, including writing and reviewing
papers, security research funding, giving talks, presenting posters,
making a personal website, job opportunities in universities and
industry, and teaching.

### BMI 883/884 merger

Originally, BMI 883 and 884 were separate single-credit courses
taught in the fall and spring semesters, respectively, and meeting for
50 minutes each week. They are now merged into a
single 2-credit course that meets twice weekly. Students are to enroll
for both course numbers and will be assigned a single, common grade
for the two courses.


### Learning outcomes

- Students will be able to describe the review processes for journal articles and research grant proposals.
- Students will be able to write clear, well-formed journal articles and research grant proposals.
- Students will be able to give a clear oral presentation of their research work.
- Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of research on unconscious bias (for example, in reviewing papers/grants, in writing/evaluating recommendation letters, and in hiring/promotion) and assumptions and strategies to overcome them.
- Students will be able to describe good practices for research scientists’ participation in social media.
- Students will be able to describe strategies for forming and managing scientific collaborations.
- Students will be able to identify employment opportunities at universities and in industry and demonstrate understanding of strategies for applying and interviewing for such positions.
- Students will be able to describe and compare different teaching practices and methods for motivating students.

### Discussion

The primary course activity will be discussion. Be prepared, be
engaged, listen, and be respectful.

I ask that everyone strive toward the following:

#### Norms for discussion

- Presume positive intentions
- Engage respectfully
- Listen attentively
- Aim for equal participation
- Respect boundaries
- Provide evidence



### Course grade

Course grade will be based on class participation (70%) and
2 homework assignments (30%).

The homework assignments will include: writing an abstract, and
writing a 2 min elevator speech.

The class participation grade will be based on participation in each
session, scored according to the following rubric:

> **Good contributor**: Contributions in class reflect thorough
> preparation. Ideas offered are usually substantive, provide good
> insights and sometimes direction for the class. Challenges are well
> substantiated and often persuasive. (Score 3/3)
>
> **Adequate contributor**: Contributions in class reflect satisfactory
> preparation. Ideas offered are sometimes substantive, provide
> generally useful insights but seldom offer a new direction for the
> discussion. Challenges are sometimes presented, fairly well
> substantiated, and are sometimes persuasive. (Score 2/3)
>
> **Weak contributor**: Contributions in class reflect inadequate
> preparation. Ideas offered are seldom substantive, provide few if any
> insights and never a constructive direction for the class.
> Integrative comments and effective challenges are absent. (Score 1/3)
>
> **Non-participant**: Says little or nothing in class.
> Hence, there is not an adequate basis for evaluation. (Score 0/3)

**Grading scale**: 92-100 (A), 87-91 (AB), 82-86 (B), 77-81 (BC), 70-76
(C), 60-69 (D), <60 (F)

Students are encouraged to discuss course content and homework
assignments with each other, but the homework
assignments are to be each student’s own, separate work.

### Assignments

#### Readings

Assigned readings appear in the [course schedule](schedule.html).
Students are expected to complete the reading assignments in advance
of discussion.

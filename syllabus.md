A variety of skills that are important for a successful research
career are often left to students to develop on their own. This course
attempts to fill many of those gaps, including writing and reviewing
papers, security research funding, giving talks, presenting posters,
making a personal website, job opportunities in universities and
industry, and teaching.

### Learning outcomes

- Students will be able to describe the review processes for journal articles and research grant proposals.
- Students will be able to write clear, well-formed journal articles and research grant proposals.
- Students will be able to give a clear oral presentation of their research work.
- Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of how diversity issues impact research and work environments
- Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of research on unconscious bias (for example, in reviewing papers/grants, in writing/evaluating recommendation letters, and in hiring/promotion) and assumptions and strategies to overcome them.



### Course grade

Course grade will be based on class participation (40%),
3 homework assignments (45%), and an in-class presentation on
their research work (15%).

The homework assignments will include: writing a review of a paper,
writing an abstract to present at a scientific meeting, and writing
the specific aims page for a grant proposal.

The class participation grade will be based on participation in each
session, scored according to the following rubric:

> **Good contributor**: Contributions in class reflect thorough
> preparation. Ideas offered are usually substantive, provide good
> insights and sometimes direction for the class. Challenges are well
> substantiated and often persuasive. (Score 3/3)
>
> **Adequate contributor**: Contributions in class reflect satisfactory
> preparation. Ideas offered are sometimes substantive, provide
> generally useful insights but seldom offer a new direction for the
> discussion. Challenges are sometimes presented, fairly well
> substantiated, and are sometimes persuasive. (Score 2/3)
>
> **Weak contributor**: Contributions in class reflect inadequate
> preparation. Ideas offered are seldom substantive, provide few if any
> insights and never a constructive direction for the class.
> Integrative comments and effective challenges are absent. (Score 1/3)
>
> **Non-participant**: Says little or nothing in class.
> Hence, there is not an adequate basis for evaluation. (Score 0/3)

**Grading scale**: 92-100 (A), 87-91 (AB), 82-86 (B), 77-81 (BC), 70-76
(C), 60-69 (D), <60 (F)

Students are encouraged to discuss course content and homework
assignments with each other, but the homework
assignments are to be each student’s own, separate work.

### Assignments

#### Readings

Assigned readings appear in the [course schedule](schedule.html).
Students are expected to complete the reading assignments in advance
of discussion.


#### Homework assignments

There will be three written homework assignments
The homework assignments will include: writing a review of a paper,
writing an abstract to present at a scientific meeting, and writing
the specific aims page for a grant proposal.


### Religious observances or other absences

If you need to miss class for religious observances, or any other
reason, please let the instructor know in advance, or as soon as is
feasible, so that we can try to make some accommodation.

### Academic integrity

By virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high
academic standards of the University of Wisconsin-Madison; academic
misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the
institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, and helping others commit these previously listed acts
are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action.
Examples of disciplinary action include, but is not limited to,
failure on the assignment/course, written reprimand, disciplinary
probation, suspension, or expulsion.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled
students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and
UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with
disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus
life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a
shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to
inform the instructor of their need for instructional accommodations
by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible
after a disability has been incurred or recognized. The instructor
will work either directly with the student or in coordination with the
[McBurney Center](https://mcburney.wisc.edu) to identify and provide
reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information,
including instructional accommodations as part of a student's
educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.

### Diversity and inclusion

Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for
UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the
profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status,
abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit
ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research,
outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by
creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every
background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve
Wisconsin and the world. <https://diversity.wisc.edu>

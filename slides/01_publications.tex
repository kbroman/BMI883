\begin{frame}{Tips}

  {\footnotesize

  \bi
  \item Suggest reviewers
  \item Cover letter that concisely explains why your paper is
    interesting
  \item Aim high and take forever, or
    aim in the middle and move on with your life?
  \item In revision: would like to avoid re-review (so convince editor
    that changes are minor) but don't annoy the reviewers, in case it
    does go out for re-review
  \item Make {\hilit some} change in response to each criticism
    (don't just comment)
  \item Feel free to ask editor for clarification
  \item Be prepared for pain. The process is not gentle.

Hi, I'm Karl Broman. I'm a professor at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. I'm an applied statistician working mostly on
genetics problems. I enjoy, more than anything, to help scientists
make sense of their data. And I put a lot of effort into creating
useful software to help such data analysis. I've long felt that
a central problem in data science is not so much the scale of the data
as the scale of analysis results. And I've been very interested in
how interactive data visualizations could provide a solution to that.
I would like to develop tools to help biologists explore their data
and results. Javascript, D3, and R Shiny have been huge for this,
and I would like to see these tools be even more routine.
